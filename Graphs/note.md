# Graph
## Definition
Graph $G=(V,E)$<br>
Vertices $V$<br>Edges $E$
## Vertex
- some type of object
- graph is about relationships between these objects (vertex)
- Ex) graph = relationship between flights and airports<br>
    Vertex = airport
## Edge
- connection between two vertices
- weight on edge : information about connection between two vertices
- Ex) graph = relationship between flights and airports<br>
    Edge = distance between airports
## Algorithm
### 1. Dijkstra's Algorithm
### 2. Minimum Spanning Tree
#### 2-1. Kruskal's Algorithm
#### 2-2. Prim's Algorithm
